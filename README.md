# Modulome-Explorer
**The RNA Virus Modulome** is a conceptual web platform for organizing and exploring the modular architecture of proteins encoded by the realm **Riboviria**, using **UniProtKB** entries as the primary reference system. It deploys the MetaVIRIA Ai-driven algorithm to generate prediction for protein biophysical characterisation and host predictions.
